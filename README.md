# ECC_CSCI_2_Week_11_HW_Dynamic_Queue
Create a Dynamic Queue and its Algorithms implemented via a Linked List. HW for El Camino College CSCI 2 - Data Structures.
<br><br>
 Modify the program you wrote for (last week) 
 which is as follows so it uses a queue instead of stack.
 Use the Dynamic Queue class with member functions.

 Last week’s homework:
 <br><br>
 “Design an inventory class that stores the following
 members:
 
 - serialNumber: Integer that holds a part’s serial number.
 - manufactDate: Member holding date the part was manufactured.
 - LotNum: Integer that holds the part’s lot number.

 The class should have appropriate member functions for
 storing data into, and retrieving data from, these members.

 Next, design a stack class that can hold objects of the
 class described above. If you wish, you may use the
 template you designed in Lab programming lab#2.

 Last, design a program that uses the stack class described
 above. The program should have a loop that asks the user if
 he or she wishes to add a part to inventory, or take a part
 from inventory. The loop should repeat until the user is
 finished.

 If the user wishes to add a part to inventory, the program
 should ask for the serial number, date of manufacture, and
 lot number. The data should be stored in an inventory
 object, and pushed onto the stack.

 If the user wishes to take a part from inventory, the
 program should pop the top most part from the stack and
 display the contents of its member variables.

 When the user finishes the program, it should display the
 contents of the member values of all the objects that
 remain on the stack."
